01  #include<iostream> and #include<iomanip>: These are preprocessor directives that 
include necessary header files for input/output operations (iostream) and for 
formatting output (iomanip).


02 setw(10): This is another manipulator from iomanip. It sets the width of the field
 for the next output. In this case, it sets the width to 10 characters. This means
 that the printed content will take up at least 10 characters of space, and if it's 
 shorter, the remaining space will be filled with padding.
